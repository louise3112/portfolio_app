            <AboutMeText>Having spent over 9 years' as a statistician in the public sector, I wanted a new challenge. Reflecting on my varied analytical roles, I had always gained most satisfaction from projects that allowed me significant opportunities to code, including implementing new code to automate processes; updating legacy code to reflect changes in requirements; training colleagues in using analytical coding softwares, including SAS and VBA.</AboutMeText>

            <AboutMeText>This love of coding, combined with a natural passion for solving problems (I'm an escape room fanatic with a 100% escape record!) led me to look into changing careers to software development and at the end of 2022, I started an intensive 16 week Professional Software Development course at <AboutMeLink href="https://codeclan.com/" target="_blank">CodeClan</AboutMeLink>. This portfolio reflects the projects I have completed since starting my software development journey.</AboutMeText>
